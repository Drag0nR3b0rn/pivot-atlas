## JA4+ Fingerprints

[JA4+](https://medium.com/foxio/ja4-network-fingerprinting-9376fe9ca637) is a set of methods for fingerprinting SSL/TLS clients and [servers](/artifacts/server), that builds upon its previous iterations, [JA3 and JA3S](https://engineering.salesforce.com/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967/).
