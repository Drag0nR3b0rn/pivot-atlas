# About

!!! warning "Under Construction"

## Introduction

This documentation is meant to provide cyber threat intelligence analysts with simple reference material about various methods of pivoting on threat activity observables, such as [IP addresses](/pivot-handbook/artifacts/ip_address) and [file hashes](/pivot-handbook/fingerprints/file_hash).

For any given type of observable encountered during an investigation, analysts can use this handbook to check what steps they should take to reveal potentially related infrastructure or tooling. Every listed pivoting method can be performed using one or more platforms (depending on preference or availability), and query examples are provided for the most common ones.

This project is a work in progress and cannot yet serve as a truly comprehensive guide to pivoting, but in time it could. If you would like to learn more about pivoting, I highly recommend checking out the [references section](/references). If you would like to contribute content to this project, please feel free to submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/korniko98/pivot-handbook).
